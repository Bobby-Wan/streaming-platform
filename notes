TASKS:
create page where stream is shown for selected user
add categories table to database
create browse page with categories

think about s.s. and http communication, can we verify each stream consumption request
from http somehow?

ask s.s. for streaming key
ask s.s. if stream is active somehow

alter implementation of livego to only let my http server get keys :)
may also make livego validate user 





Streaming server:
Fetching with RTMP:
build own or use existing? - building my own is madness, its a 52 page spec

only authenticated users can stream to server
so tokens are valid here


Serving:
WebM?
hit an Auth endpoint before http and streaming server?
OR proxy some urls from http server to streaming server

twitch generates a new guid for the blob url in the video element
every time i reload page

keep a database table of active streamers, each 

WebRTC:
more peer to peer
not intended for broadcasting
does it work for VOD?

HLS (LL-HLS):
seems like the solution to use
this is what twitch tv uses right now
how easy will it be to implement in browser
how will http server understand the a stream has started
    can the streaming server send info to the http server?
    or the http server will send a request every time a client requests a stream page

    OR the streamer will signal he will start streaming through http,
    then the browser will show what it is receiving from the streaming server,
    so the streamer can know when if the stream is working.

    Also, the streamer can get the key from the browser, cooler this way.
